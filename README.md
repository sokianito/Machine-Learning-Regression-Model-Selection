Machine Learning Regression for model selection

We use the following Regression models

I)	Multiple Linear Regression 
II)	Polynomial Regression 
III)	Support Vector Machine 
IV)	Decision Tree
V)	Random Forest

The Methodology that we use for the model selection we follow the steps listed below 

I)	Split the dataset into Training and Test set (20% split for the test set)
II)	Train the model using the training set
III)	Select the model with the highest R^2
